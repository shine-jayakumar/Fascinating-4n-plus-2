The function, [4n+2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4n_+_2), is already famous, but I recently stumbled upon a simple question on one of those short 10 second videos. So, I decided to pop open a Jupyter Notebook and decided to explore a bit more. I had already found the answer to the initial question, but I also discovered a pattern in these numbers.

I wouldn't say that this repository is done and dusted. It had amazed me enough to keep coming back to it and add my findings.

Meanwhile, I urge you to take a look at what I would like to share.
